# Ionic-FinalProject
The following app was my final project for my mobile web development course. 
The students were encourage to learn a new mobile web language that allows for cross platform use, 
instead of using  jQuery Mobile, I decided to learn Ionic V2. 
The following app uses login credentials, a graph mathematical function and a quiz function that could be improved later on, and act as a tool for elementary school teachers.

Here is a link to view a demo of the application
